\section{Evaluation of Lamella Lifetime}


\subsection{File: GetLifetimes.py - deprecated}

\subsubsection{Information}
This script was only necessary for the measurement of the lamellas during the development stage. 
There the device was coupled to the computer and only the intensity data was logged. 

\subsubsection{Usage}

After start of the GetLifetimes.py-script a dialog for selecting the raw data files opens. Here one needs to select the measurement data of the laser with ending \"0\". (The other data files are selected automatically.) Afterwards a filedialog opens, which allows to select the Save-File. 

The created file has two columns. The first is the number of the lamella, the second is the corresponding lifetime.
